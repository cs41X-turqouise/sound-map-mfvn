      <i><h1>About Sound Map For Changing Landscape</h1></i>
      <h2>Welcome and Introduction: </h2>
      <p>Welcome to Sound Map For Changing Landscape about page, where we are happy to present our creative solution aimed
        at focus on the critical issue of climate change in the Tidewater Region.</p>
      <h2>Description of the Interactive Sound Map: </h2>
      <p>The Interactive Sound Map is a critical tool for tackling global sea-level rise, with a particular emphasis on
        the
        Chesapeake Bay region. It provides a dynamic awareness of the shifting aural landscapes as sea levels rise. Users
        can listen to and upload sound recordings, enabling community involvement among people affected and worried by
        environmental changes.
      </p>
      <h2>Problem Background</h2>
      <p>In the Chesapeake Bay region, rising sea levels present a range of critical issues, including erosion, flooding,
        saltwater contamination, and habitat destruction. These interconnected challenges demand a coordinated and timely
        response to protect both the environment and local communities.</p>
        <hr>
      <h2>Problem Characteristics: </h2>
      <p>Our Interactive Sound Map project combines historical records with present user contributions to create a
        complete
        perspective of the aural landscapes of the Chesapeake Bay. Historical records provide insights into the past,
        recording the region's rich history and providing as a crucial point of reference for change. </p>
        <hr>
      <h2>Solution Statement & Characteristics: </h2>
      <p>We have a solution: a special map with sounds that shows how the weather is changing in the Tidewater Region.
        our map combines old and new audio and video from people like you to help us understand things better.</p>
